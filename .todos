The idea of this document is to list and describe the features we still want to add to Daily.
Our top-priority is to make sure we finish the features we need to make it a viable alternative to the current Daily.
That's important to keep our focus on, as it is really hard to focus on that when we have so many ideas for the future.

    - Tasks inside groups need to have a quick way to be moved to the inbox
    Processing the Inbox:
      Processing the inbox is the process of categorizing tasks that are in the inbox, in a way that will help both the algorithm and the user understand which group the task belongs to, as well as it's property in relation to the rest of the tasks.
      - When the user starts to process the inbox, it needs to start a new session of N minutes, defined in the settings
      - The UI to process the inbox should be a modal
        - The user should be able to see the task's name
        - The user should be able to see the task's description
        - The user should be able to see the task's due date
        - The user should be able to see the task's pomodoro length
        - The user should be able to see the task's max pomodoro count per day
        - The user should have a link to the task's source
      The processing flow for a single task:
      The processing flow is loosely based on GTD and the Eisenhower Matrix
        - The user should be able to process the task by assigning the different missing task properties
          - Category
          - Complexity
          - Urgency
          - Impact
          - Delegability
          - Time to benefit
          - Group
  AI:
    - Attach a emoji to each task based on the task's properties
    - Alert when a new task is not actionable enough and suggest moving it to a another group
    - Suggest a categoization for the task based on the task's properties and previous tasks
